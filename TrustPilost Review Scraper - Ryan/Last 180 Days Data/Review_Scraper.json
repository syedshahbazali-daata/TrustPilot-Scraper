I tried to hit the back button to stop it but the booking came back as confirmed and they will not amend it even though it was a glitch on their website. They have asked me to contact the hotel.\n\nI am travelling with a friend and we do not want to share a bed hence me booking a twin.\n\nI am shocked & angry as I can see I am not the only person this has happened to in the last few days.\n\nBeware of using this company because I cannot understand how they can switch your room then say you cannot amend it.\n\nThis has absolutely ruined my holiday"

The info on the website was clear, and all the management they did through a verified WhatsApp business account was easy and very convenient. I made the reservation through Super.com website, they sent me a couple of WhatsApp messages with useful info prior the check-in, and all was set up for us the day we arrived at the hotel.\n\nI had a really good experience and for sure I will use Super.com again. The process is easy, convenient, and you get considerably reduced prices."

Booked 2 hotels with them, both \"non refundable\" which was a mistake. Booked under my boyfriends name, so I am writing this review for both of us. The 1 hotel we got there and it was not as nice as the pics showed online. We also found something disturbing in our room so we ended up not staying there at all. The hotel was super nice and apologized several times and understood completely why we no longer wanted to stay there. They told my bf to have super reach out to them and they will give them all the info and tell them they approve to refund him. I will never book with super again due to them giving my bf a hard time with the refund and telling him that HE has to reach out to the hotel and tell them to reach out to super via email with all the info and signature of a manager. It should NOT be the customers responsibillity, and makes NO sense why super couldn't just reach out to the hotel themselves. They need to change their ways and policies.  The hotel even agreed and told my bf that that is wrong, makes no sense, and usually the booking website are the ones to reach out to the hotel. So don't recommend using super or ever booking a non refundable hotel at all since they will give you a hard time and want sooo much info just to give you your $ back."

        "Title": "Stay away from Inn at Diamond Cove",
        "Details": "October 28, 2023\n\n\nTo Gerard Kiladjian,\n\nI am writing to tell you how extremely disappointed and upset I am about my recent stay at your hotel, Diamond\u2019s Edge. I wanted to plan something special for my husband\u2019s birthday on September 27th, and having stayed at Great Diamond Island as a kid, I thought it would be fun and romantic to stay there for his birthday. I booked this room back in July and requested one of the more expensive rooms with both a balcony and a fireplace, not knowing quite what the weather would be then. I also sent an email to the Diamond\u2019s Edge restaurant to see if I could make a reservation for dinner. This was back in July when I booked the room but got no reply. As the date got closer, I ended up calling and they said the restaurant wasn\u2019t even open due to new fall hours. When I said I needed to cancel then, he said that we could get breakfast, lunch and dinner \u201cup at the lodge\u201d, so I decided to still go. It seems it wouldn\u2019t be a fancy dinner but we could have dinner, so that was ok I thought.\n\nWhen we arrived at the dock there was no one there to meet us \u2013 someone called up to the hotel, but still no show so the bus driver (for the island perhaps) said he would give us a ride after he dropped off someone else.\n\nWhen we arrived at the room and tried to turn on the fireplace it wasn\u2019t working. This was one of the most important aspects of the room to me. First, we couldn\u2019t even find anywhere to turn it on. Then, when we asked downstairs at the desk, they said someone had to turn it on. So we requested that \u2013 though if you purchase a room with a fireplace, I would expect it to be ready for us. .  . However when the kid \u2013 yes kid- came to try and fix it \u2013 he couldn\u2019t \u2013 so no fireplace.\n\nThe final straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was dinner. We came down to have dinner and was told the chef had called in sick and there was no food to be had. Are you freaking kidding me? We\u2019re on an island, with nowhere else to get food, paid $250.00 for a room and can\u2019t eat!\nThis is so unacceptable. A bit later the waiter came over and said, \u201cThey had found some frozen pizzas\u201d and we could have that \u2013 wow \u2013 great and not even comped!\n\nWe couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there. Really nice job providing my husband, who works so INCREDIBLY hard, a horrible birthday.\n\nI do know you were closing soon after, but that is no excuse. Every customer should be treated the same and have the same amenities whether it\u2019s the first day of opening or the last. I am appalled that an establishment that boasts about what a wonderful getaway like this would treat their customers this way. I am also from Maine, so you can bet I will be posting some reviews about this unless you refund me my money.\n\nOn top of it all we were in such a hurry to make sure we got the first boat out of there that I put my $300.00 Maui Jim sunglasses down for a minute, waiting for the boat, forgot to pick them up and so am now out ANOTHER $300.00. UNBELIEVEABLE!!!\n\nMary Lou & Dominic"

They even provided me with the cancellation document. Long story short, is been two months, Super.com never got in touch with the hotel and keeps telling me that their travel partner (Hotel) needs to authorize the refund (Already did) and keep making empty promises. Hotel claims since they made the cancellation they do not have the money, so Super.com is clearly scamming me. Please, don't book through their platform, cheaper things sometimes end up being more expensive. I was a tourist and had to spend the night at an acquaintance's house because I was left without a place to stay."

I told them these booking as instant and we get a reply from the hotel right away or one can confirm with the hotel as soon as the booking is done but because they are scammer so they dont anything in place and just keep lying that we are working I am going to attch some screenshot of the conversation and unfortunately have no choice apart from raising a charge back claim via mastercard to get my \u00a3677 back from these scammers.\n\nNote: All screenshot of conversation is saved and will update the outcome once sorted with bank\n\n\nReply to Super : Absolutely rubbish explanation, I am frequent traveller and this had never ever happen before to me with any booking i have made using different 3rd party agent over 20 years and if you want i can post the email reply i have received from hotel who confirmed in writing that they dont have any booking with my details so your lie is caught here if they can access the booking system for December why cant they see the booking? Where there business model is based on availability and offer the room in market so why they will keep that hidden ? Doesnt make any sense anyway you guys are scammer and have been reported to my bank for a charge back so good luck scamming people but i wont let you go that easily \nThanks"

I\u2019ve had a great experience to date which is the only reason why I\u2019m giving a 2 star rating, but tonight I experienced unfortunate troubles. I arrived to check in only to find that the hotel didn\u2019t have records of my booking. My 2 night stay is paid for, confirmed and is the correct location and dates, but 90 minutes later I still don\u2019t have a room to check into and Super customer service team hasn\u2019t called me back to handle the situation after having called them three times now for help only to find that no one can help me. Disappointed with this recent experience using Super.com. Not sure if I\u2019ll use them again or not because of this.\n\nUpdate one week later:  I've been charged for a room that I didn't get due to an outage that happened at hotel during my time of booking. Fortunately, they had one room left, so I purchased it directly from the hotel through a separate booking. But 7 days later, this issue is still not resolved after several attempts by myself, and hotel management to contact Super.com. They have great prices on rooms, but beware if you every have problems like this as they are terrible when it comes to customer service response and support. Super.com responds quickly to Trustpilot reviews, but not to emails or phone calls. Piece of advice: Call your hotel in advance to make sure they have your reservation on file!"

(There were practically zero details apart from the name of the room.) \nThe dismissive style of the representative and the speed of his responses makes me think this must be happening all the time, he was replying in the chat within a few seconds from me typing, they must have some stock responses exactly for this scenario, they must be doing this all the time.\n\nEDIT: I read your reply, which I find a bit patronising because I know exactly what I booked. Interestingly enough, when I went to the hotel I was informed that breakfast WAS included after all, which is exactly what I had booked. Your confirmation email was wrong, and so was your customer rep that I chatted with, and so was the person who answered this review - which tells me that in reality you have absolutely no idea. You just default to \"it's always the customer's fault, bye bye now\".\nsuper.com - never again."

I was out of town, and decided to stay another night, I used this site because it was cheaper than the others, when I got to the hotel and hour later, they could not find my reservation, so I went to dinner and came back and still not reservation. I had to do a chat online to speak to someone, and they said that it could take hours before my reservation would show up, but they would escalate my situation to the top. Another hour later, nothing. So I went to booking.com and did another reservation, that showed up seconds later at the hotel desk. I finally got someone on the phone, and then they hung up on me, and I have been trying since October 14th to get my money back, and it is now October 20th. They want an invoice from the hotel, but my reservation with them never showed up, so how do they think I can give them an invoice? They took my $150.00, they should be able to put it right back on my account. I do not recommend this company. Stay away.\n\n\n\nthey are asking for a reply::: my booking number was B_11601721 and i have a total of 8 emails, confirmation # 4181.278.417.... but no help whatsoever"

Two weeks later my money is still on hold and my bank says that Super needs to cancel the transaction in order the release the money. So I again call Super and am continuously asked for a confirmation number which I don\u2019t have. It takes forever to get the agent to understand the situation all while continuously being told the same text book answers. I ask for a supervisor and am told it is \u201cagainst company policy to have customers speak to a supervisor\u201d then magically it is possible and I should expect a call back from their supervisor. Surprise, I do not get a call back. \nDid this 3 more times over 3 days and to this day haven\u2019t had any solution to my issue. Currently waiting for yet another call back I probably won\u2019t get and don\u2019t know when I will be able to access my money thanks to the incompetence of Super.com\n\nEdit after Super.com comment:\n\nThank you for the email. I have asked for documentation, like the one now provided via email, multiple times, when I called Super. I was told each time that this was not possible. So I wonder, why all of a sudden it is possible? Why lie to me, clearly it is possible.\nFurthermore is there any reason for not calling me back as promised? Was this also a lie?\n\nThis could\u2019ve been handled a lot faster if Super would have just sent that documentation the first day that I called customer support. Why did it take a week and a half and a trust pilot review to get this done?"

I was assured at the time that I would revieve 5% additional compensation in cash however afterwoods it turns out that this was credit and I was lied too.\n\nI have continually tried getting in contact with super.com as their error and incompetence not only left me in a bad position in athens but also short financially (cost of calling their US only number and the hiked price I had to pay finding an alternative hotel on the same day).

Super.com provided a canned response and there are more details. On the day the reservation an affiliate of Super.com called \"Webbeds\" tried to make a reservation at the hotel where Super.com had forgot to book (a month after billing me). The hotel flagged it as fraud and refused the reservation. They shared the number for Webbeds, who I followed up with. Super.com had, without authorization and in an unsecured way, shared both my personal information and my payment information with Webbeds."

They are faceless and I am powerless with no UK registered address or phone. Avoid them at all costs!!!!!

        "Title": "Extremely Deceptive and Unhelpful Experience with Super.com",
        "Details": "I have recently had the most disappointing and frustrating experience with Super.com. My interaction with this company has been characterized by extreme deception and a complete lack of assistance when I encountered an issue with a hotel booking through their \"Super Booking Application.\"\n\nI made a reservation for the Ibis Doha hotel (B_11553815) for the dates of October 12th and 13th. However, the confirmation I received indicated entirely different dates - October 19th and 20th. This is not only misleading but could be seen as outright fraudulent.\n\nDespite immediately reaching out to their customer service department to address this significant discrepancy, my experience went from bad to worse. Super.com's automated services proved to be completely unhelpful, refusing to correct the glaring mistake. Even when confronted with an issue that was clearly caused by their platform, they insisted on not assisting or making any effort to rectify the situation. \n\nThis level of unresponsiveness and lack of accountability is simply unacceptable, especially when dealing with an issue that could impact someone's travel plans and financial well-being. \n\nWhat's more, when it became evident that Super.com would do whatever it takes to avoid any contact and refuse to solve any issues that might arise, I took the initiative to report the transaction as fraud to my bank. The lack of response from Super.com left me with no other viable option to protect my interests and financial well-being.\n\nThis level of unresponsiveness, coupled with their failure to take responsibility for their errors and misleading information, is simply unacceptable. It is an affront to customer trust and confidence.\n\nI would strongly advise anyone considering using Super.com to think twice. My experience has been a complete letdown, and I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to be cautious when relying on their services. Their inability or unwillingness to rectify mistakes of this nature is a red flag, and their commitment to customer satisfaction is, at best, questionable.\n\nIn sum, my experience with Super.com has been marred by deception, a complete lack of assistance, and a failure to take responsibility for a glaring error on their part. I urge anyone considering their services to proceed with extreme caution, as my experience has left me highly dissatisfied and disappointed."

The customer service in the chat was terrible, 3 times they promised to get back to us in 20 minutes but nothing happend. After our 20 hour trip we had to wait 2 hours without getting any help from them. Being on the other side of the world in a new city, awake for 22 hours we at least expected them to book something else for us because we already paid, but no help at all. After 2 hours we had to give up waiting to get some sleep before the wedding and book something ourselves. The cheapest price we could found was 3 times more than what we already paid for and way over our budget! we can not afford it and had to put savings in to cover our Hotel cost but had no other alternative. We just feel sad and scammed about this whole situation and got our trip ruined."

I happened to type the hotel name on Google search, and various websites and prices came up for the hotel. One of the websites was \u201csuper.com\u201d, and wow! I was stunned by the price. I decided to check it out. I was dubious at first as I had never heard of it before, so I had to check it out on Trustpilot to see if it was genuine. I saw that it was, so I booked and never regretted it. The booking was quick and easy. I then rang the hotel to make sure the booking went through, and it did. \nI had never expected to pay the price I have for something so last minute and so close to the city centre so thank you \u201csuper.com\u201d I\u2019ll be using you again! \ud83d\ude0a \n\nStephanie"

Stay away or go with other better reputable customer care companies. Take everything they say with a pinch of salt. Do not go for a deal purely on cheap value cos when things go wrong you will end up paying a lot more like I did. Stay away from them and seek other companies. Saving some money is not worth the hassle stress and time dealing with such a poor company!!\n1. I had website issues with adding enhanced protection a. Website wouldn't accept my amex when selected the option or wouldn't let me check out when I use normal bank. If unselected the option it let me check out with normal bank card. I needed enhance protection due to mental health issues but didn't want to lose my booking. I booked at night and called immediately the next day to explain. Customer service told me that this is not an issue they can help with. I was more than willing to pay the extra! But they wouldn't do nothing at all.\n\n2. I wasn't happy with this response at all. No compassion or empathy just cold. I wasn't asking for anything for free even. Customer rep suggested I call their customer service to speak to someone. They said it was a free number. I called.. spent more than 1 hour on call. I hang up. I get a text from my provider. I have lost access to calls, data and messge because I have incurred a charge of 100\u00a3+ for calling a US number. Now I have to pay 100\u00a3+ for calling a number which to this day super.com. claim is free even though I keep telling them I've been charged but they say they don't care. That's not their issue. Speak to my provider. Even though they know I am from UK they still said call for free..\n\n3. Might lose my booking of 80\u00a3 and now put of pocket of 111\u00a3 - nearly 200\u00a3 lost. Not to mention the stress and anxiety caused by dealing with them. Not been able to sleep at all!!\n\nI have wasted my whole weekend dealing with this. Pathetic and disgusting behaviour from customer rep."

I tried again a day later on help chat AND via their phone number where I was told that I had been booked into the correct hotel, even though I showed them confirmation that I had not. They basically did nothing so now I have put my credit card payment on hold and reported them for fraud. They are fraudulently selling hotel rooms and then putting you in a different hotel.

        "Details": "This company did something I found to be deceptive and very frustrating.  While travelling, I stopped to book a motel at my next stop.  Super dot com had a reasonable rate for the room I needed.  I typed in the data, and proceeded to the payment page.  Without any notice, the booking shifted my stay date two days forward.  So without my knowledge, I paid for a room I couldn't use!  Super didn't allow for any changes after I paid, saying the item was non-refundable.  I made a mistake and didn't see the change in dates.  I feel it is important for such a booking arrangement to warn customers when anything changes from booking to payment, before allowing payment.  Why?  Because without warning -- how are we to expect anything has changed?  This was underhanded business, and I will tell everyone I know that \"Super\" is not super.  They're a scam, and I ended up paying more than $170 for a room I wasn't able to use.  The hotel (Holiday Inn) refused to intervene, saying they had nothing to do with the booking.  On the website, there's no contact information, and the only way I got back to the company to \"chat\" online with a representative was when I got back home, and he said he couldn't do anything.  Too bad, so sad, huh?  OK then.  I say stay away from \"Super dot com.\""

I was advised the reservation would be cancelled. This all happened within an hour. \n\nI received ZERO confirmation from Super or anyone else. When the charge came on my credit card, there was no Merchant name. Just said \u201creservation Farview.\n\nFarview tried to be helpful, but they were unable to tell me who I had booked with and said they were never paid. \n\nThe credit card company offered a brief refund after I disputed the charge, but subsequently recharged me and provided some vague documentation on the company and the charges. \n\nDue to an airline cancellation, this trip NEVER happened, leaving me with a hotel bill, $40 more than it should have been, with no recourse, despite the fact they assured me they cancelled my reservation. That may be why they didn\u2019t get paid either. \n\nUpon research, many sites have mentioned that unless you are 100% sure you are going and have looked at other booking options. I agree wholeheartedly. \n\nThey also mentioned Steph Curry is involved with this venture. BOO. I used to like him. \n\nBEWARE!!!"

I was trying to book a hotel stay for an upcoming visit to South Africa, but the booking kept failing to complete. I double checked all my card info and it was correct. So then I changed to PayPal Credit instead, which only requires me to login to PayPal, but the booking still failed to complete. Then I thought perhaps it was a problem with my current location, and maybe Super.com doesn't allow bookings from people located in Mexico (I'm a U.S. citizen with a U.S. bank and U.S. address, but I was in Mexico while attempting this booking). So I turned on my VPN and tried again. That actually caused the site to not even attempt the booking. It just did nothing at all. So then I turned off my VPN and remote accessed my VPS, which is located in the U.S. and tried from that machine. But even there, with a U.S. IP address and no VPN, I still got the same \"Booking incomplete\" message.\n\nSo at this point, I started a support chat with a live agent. The agent (Hannah Mae) simply wanted to give me cookie cutter responses that she would copy/paste into the chat, without actually reading my messages that described all the things I'd tried. Eventually, she ran out of copy/paste responses, and then told me there's nothing they can do. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, she told me there was no point, because the supervisor would only tell me the same things. When I insisted, she simply ended the chat and I was presented with a survey of my experience.\n\nI will definitely not be doing business with Super.com again."

        "Details": "I booked a hotel in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend about a month in advance through Super. The rate I got seemed almost too good to be true, and indeed it was. I read mixed reviews but the negative ones were where Super never booked the hotel. To try and avoid it, I contacted the hotel to make sure my booking was confirmed a couple weeks out. The hotel didn\u2019t have any record of my booking so I contacted Super who assured me they had made the booking and it was the fault of the hotel who hadn\u2019t put it in their system. They told me they\u2019d follow up just to be sure. Days goes by, nothing. It was coming up on a week out and the end of the refundable cancellation period so I checked with the hotel again and still same thing so followed up with Super. They assured me this time they\u2019d have it handled that night and I\u2019d get a call, that never came. I ended up making a separate reservation directly through the hotel just in case because I didn\u2019t want to get to the hotel and not have a reservation. That\u2019s exactly what would\u2019ve happened if I hadn\u2019t done this though, despite Super lying and assuring me several times, when I arrived at the hotel they had no record of my reservation through Super and the hotel was fully booked. Super did nothing to help remedy the situation and it was 10 pm by the time I got to the hotel, so I would\u2019ve been without accommodations late at night if I had not booked a safety reservation, at 3x the rate I got through Super.  Will never book through them again and I\u2019d advise against anyone else from doing so.\n\nI did end up getting a refund from Super unlike many others, however I still ended up paying much more for the hotel then I would\u2019ve if I booked directly through them, on a different 3rd party site, or at a similar hotel in the area when I booked a month out instead of my last minute booking where rates were much higher. So still came out at a loss but did rightfully get a refund."

Total scam of money being taken from people that doesn't need to be. Be aware."

        "Details": "*UPDATE 5th October*\nI have received the below reply from customer service, which quite clearly does not address my complaint at all. I stayed in the hotel 2months ago so why would I now be trying to change or cancel the booking.\n\nSuperTravel HelpDesk\n4:56\u202fAM (5 hours ago)\nto me\n\nHi there,\n\nI'm saddened to hear that you would like to cancel your booking. Please be advised that I've reviewed the policy on this booking, and it's non-refundable and non-amendable. Unfortunately, this means that we are unable to make any changes to your booking, and a cancellation will not result in a refund. Please note that this was communicated on the booking form, and later on the confirmation page. Thank you for understanding.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nMy original review:\n\nWhile Super.com may initially catch your eye with their competitive hotel booking prices, my experience with their customer service has been nothing short of disappointing, disorganised, and, most significantly, exorbitantly costly.\n\nI found myself with a problem when my friend and I mistakenly booked hotel accommodations for the wrong dates. With our travel date fast approaching, we knew we needed to rectify the situation as swiftly as possible. Super.com offered a glimmer of hope, stating that, for an administrative fee and pending the hotel's approval, they could attempt to amend our reservation. We were told that their amendments team would liaise with the hotel on our behalf.\n\nHowever, this is where the ordeal began. For an entire week, we received no updates, despite sending follow-up emails. Frustrated and running out of time, I decided to call the customer service team using the phone number displayed on the Super.com website. Little did I know that this call would cost me a whopping \u00a3555 ($689), a fee that was never disclosed beforehand. During those excruciating days leading up to our trip, I made a total of nine phone calls to Super.com, mostly spent waiting on hold or in a queue.\n\nTo make matters worse, it turned out that no one from Super.com had actually contacted the hotel on our behalf, as they had claimed in their email and on the phone. I personally reached out to the hotel, only to find out that they had no record of Super.com's communication. This blatant misrepresentation of their efforts left us bewildered and frustrated.\n\nAfter numerous phone calls and conflicting information, we received an email from customer services stating that they could not amend our booking, even with the hotel's approval. Instead, they suggested that we contact the hotel ourselves to request a refund and then obtain written approval to send back to Super.com. This was a stark contradiction to the information we had initially received. Exhausted from the runaround and time constraints, we had no choice but to change our plans and book new flights to accommodate the existing reservation.\n\nTo our surprise, shortly after our decision, we received yet another email from a different Super.com representative claiming that they were diligently working with the hotel to change our dates and were awaiting a call back from the hotel. This sudden change in stance only added to our confusion and frustration.\n\nWhile Super.com's customer service can be reached via email, their response times are painfully slow, rendering meaningful communication nearly impossible, especially when time-sensitive travel plans are involved. Moreover, the misinformation they provided about their communication with the hotel demonstrated a lack of honesty in assisting us.\n\nWhile we acknowledge our initial mistake, it was Super.com's initial assurance that they could assist us (for a fee) that led us to persist in seeking their help. The eventual revelation that they couldn't provide the service they had promised was not only immensely frustrating but also costly, as evidenced by my shockingly high phone bill.\n\nI have submitted this complaint to Super.com, and despite more than a week passing, including a follow-up email, I have yet to receive any response from them regarding this matter. I am also exploring my consumer rights regarding the undisclosed call charges incurred.\n\nI remain open to discussing this matter with Super.com if they respond to my emails\n\nUPDATE: despite providing super.com with my details as they requested in their reply below I have still not been contacted by them or received a reply to my emails."

I received a \"Confirmation\" from Super.com with their Confirmation number.   The Hotel DOES NOT HAVE A RESERVATION IN MY NAME OR IN SUPER NAME ALLOTED TO ME.  As of today Sept 13, the Hotel STILL does not have the booking in their reservation system.  I have called, and e-mailed, repeatedly since making the reservation, was told that \"Don't worry, your reservation is confirmed\" but they REFUSE to put me in touch with a Supervisor or Manager, despite repeatedly asking to speak with one.  I was told I would receive a call back in 24-48 hours, but no call backs from anyone.  Sometimes, I received an e-mail back stating \"We are working on resolving your issue\".  If I respond to that e-mail, I get back nothing.  I have contacted the Hotel repeatedly as well and they confirm that this site has a history of not having legitimate reservations.  The Super.com actually states that sometimes the reservation does not appear in the Hotel Booking system until day of check in!!!! Are we really that naive and would accept a booking that cannot be confirmed with the property? Needless to say, I have cancelled the reservation and am awaiting credit card return credit.  I already anticipate issues with getting the refund as well.\n\nYOUR RESPONSE IS BS.  RESERVATIONS AT HOTEL (NOT CENTRAL BOOKING) CONFIRMED THEY HAVE INFO AVAILABLE WITHIN 24 H of  LEGITIMATE 3rd PARTY BOOKINGS."

        "Details": "Title: Beware of super.com: A Scam Website with Appalling Customer Service\n\nReview:\n\nI recently had an extremely frustrating and disheartening experience with super.com, and I feel compelled to share my story in hopes of saving others from falling victim to their deceitful practices and abysmal customer service.\n\nFirst and foremost, let me address the cancellation policy. In the face of a genuine family emergency, I contacted super.com hoping to cancel a month-long booking I had made. To my disbelief, they flat out refused to accommodate my request, displaying a complete lack of empathy and understanding. Their inflexibility left me not only in a dire situation but also questioning their ethics and integrity as a travel website.\n\nThe customer service I encountered from super.com was nothing short of atrocious. Their representatives were dismissive, unhelpful, and displayed an outrageous level of unprofessionalism. They seemed disinterested in providing any real assistance, instead preferring to brush off my concerns with pre-written, unhelpful responses. It is disheartening to witness such a blatant disregard for customers' needs and a complete lack of respect.\n\nFurthermore, attempting to resolve the issue through their website proved to be utterly futile. Their website design is convoluted, making it difficult to locate any relevant information or find a prompt resolution. It became clear to me that they purposefully make it challenging to communicate with them, likely to dissuade dissatisfied customers from pursuing their valid grievances.\n\nIn light of my appalling experience, I have decided to escalate this matter by involving my state representative. It is evident that super.com operates with a complete disregard for their customers' well-being and their own ethical responsibilities. It is my hope that an investigation into their practices will shed light on their fraudulent activities, ultimately protecting future prospective customers from falling into their trap.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly advise everyone to avoid super.com at all costs. Their refusal to accommodate emergencies and their disgraceful customer service prove that they are nothing more than a scam website. It is not worth risking your hard-earned money, time, and peace of mind by engaging with this unscrupulous company. Choose reputable alternatives that prioritize customer satisfaction and operate with integrity.I"

        "Title": "I was scammed out of $196.97 by\u2026",
        "Details": "I was scammed out of $196.97 by super.com  I tried to book a hotel in my state, but reservation was in wrong state. Had nowhere to stay, called super who promised to cancel and They promised in writing on August 7 2023 to refund minus a $30 fee. A month later, they still have not and refuse now through PayPal to refund. PayPal who I spend over $10,000 a month through, has not backed me up. I will stop using PAYPAL. Definitely book your hotels elsewhere, without super.com they are dishonest scammers. RUN, don't walk away from SUPER.COM robbery. Also, don't book with pay in 4 with PayPal. They may not back you up when things go wrong with super.com\n\nDetails: The issue is not about the erroneous booking and my fault or system fault or their policies on changing or canceling, but the fact that I was indeed promised the refund after cancelling it just a few hours later when i discovered the problem and that super went back on their word after telling me what to do for a refund. I assume they thought I couldnt actually get it done. However, i jumped through all the hoops to do what super.com supervisor Monica on August 7, 2023 at 6:13 PM EST asked me to do to get a FULL refund exception with NO fee: contact the hotel, get it in writing that they authorized the cancellation under the circumstances (so they can release and re-rent the room) and email  it to Monica, then call to confirm it was received. I did it all.  Amazingly, the hotel sent me the documentation requesting that super.com refund me in full and help find me another hotel. The hotel manager said they wouldn't dream of keeping my money. I sent it over to Monica and called. It was confirmed again by Michelle, a different supervisor at 7:50 PM EST that I would get a full refund with the notes and the hotel document she read.  \n\nSuper.com did not do as promised twice by phone and refund in full. They also didn't refund anything at all.\n\nAt 7:25PM EST on August 7th, someone else at super.com (not a supervisor or manager this time) Jannah in the support department, simply sent an email stating they would refund MINUS $30. However, super.com.com didn't keep their word on this secondary promise either. They simply stopped replying for a month, and then simply refused to refund when contacted by Paypal, despite me meeting their requests and them giving their word. No responses at all... Now that i have posted all this,  super.com has the time and concern to reply? Interesting ...\n\nThe takeaway: they will lie to get you off the phone, but not keep their word. When things go wrong, can you trust them to do what's fair or right? Can you trust their word? When they are not being charged by the hotel (verified in writing) but try to keep the amount of the room rate for themselves alone after promising a refund... I think not. Read the other reviews about poor customer service, being ignored with billing issues, etc. BELIEVE them."

There is a selection of cereal available 24/7 as well. The room was clean. Other reviews have said the furniture was sparse. In my opinion, everything was there that you need - a small table with two chairs, a desk, an area next to desk where a suitcase could be set. I appreciate that the chairs were plastic, easy to keep clean. (I shudder sometimes at cloth covered dirty chairs in other hotel rooms.) A light on both sides of the bed. A floor to ceiling mirror so you can view yourself before heading out. While, other hotels you can only see your face. \nShampoo and body soap dispenser in a large walk-in shower. A safe to lock valuable items. What more could one ask for? Also TV with remote, which is usual, but there was a remote for air conditioner, and the air conditioner worked well with little noise. Bed was comfy and clean. First thing I check when I enter a hotel room.\nThat's it. It's a 10!"

We were offered an earlier appointment so I contacted super.com to try and amend the dates and they sent me a cut and paste response saying it's completely non refundable. I tried to respond but they had closed the ticket so I couldn't email back! Opened a new ticket and sent another message this time with a screenshot of the refund terms and got the same message back and ticket closed again. Terrible customer service, mis-sold products, totally scam. Have now messed around the hospital and have to stick with our original appointment because super.com are a business that just want to fleece people. Do not recommend."

In regards to the problem around my children, I took photos as the man put his hands all in my face and was very disrespectful to me. I explained this to the company and they have no empathy in regards to the issue with me and my family being stuck in the car while my money is in limbo with this company who refuses to give me a refund until they speak with a manager. I don't have a reservation right then and there is calls for me either to have a reservation or my money back.  I spoke a Sev, Mabel, and Elle.  Elle had a dog barking in the background I could not even understand her or hear her. The agents had very broken English and had no empathy and should not have anything to do with customer service."

It had good water pressure, and consistent temperature. \nVery clean room in comparison to many other places in the area.

The company are near on impossible to contact. The links on their website do not work. Their customer service number , which is based in America rang for 25 minutes, saying we were in position one in the queue, it then cut off. The comoany made no attempt to contact us and didn\u2019t respond to our call or emails. My husband went through a complaint company to contact super.com. Who then confirmed our hotel will be closed. They offered no replacement accommodation and had no intention of notifying us before arrival.  Avoid at all cost, rip off!"

It was clear and to the point such as confirmation of booking, validation of dates, place, and room type, along with links for directions and uber info if needed, including survey satisfaction.  I became at ease as they delivered updates with promptness and readiness that a follow-up was not even required.\n\nI will be sure to check Super.com again before planning another destination or get-a-way.  Bottom line though, as long as Super.com has unbeatable prices that are unmatched in the period chosen, then I would definitely consider booking with them again."

I called them back multiple times and finally got them to escalate the call to a manager, Mark Louie. He called me back and the phone rang 3 times and disconnected - I did not have time to catch the call before he hung up. He then responded via email (despite my request for a phone call) stating the reservation was non refundable and I needed a letter with signatures from the hotel owner and others stating they could refund me. I responded via email that they need to check my call where the customer service rep said I would be refunded. I emailed them 2-3 times with no response. I called back multiple times and Mark Louie called me back, only repeating it was non refundable and then the phone disconnected mid conversation. I tried calling back repeatedly but never heard from him again. I finally got the information of a new Supervisor, Annie, who was sympathetic to my situation and agreed they should honor what I was told originally and that she would negotiate a deal. I then received an Email from her stating I would not be refunded without that letter. My father passed away a month after the fire and I do not have time to jump through hoops, especially after I was told by the company I would receive my refund. A legitimate, reputable company would stay true to their word and not fight someone in their time of need. They are not a honorable and trustworthy business and I can only feel as though I've been scammed. And if you have to contact them after your reservation has been made, good luck getting through to them, especially if you need to speak to a manager. Beware doing business with SuperTravel"

For this reason I knew she needed her own bed on our vacation and so I booked a 2 bedroom hotel room. When I got to the hotel they informed me super travel had booked wrong room and they had no 2 bedroom rooms left. I contacted super travel who admitted to the mistake. I asked super travel to cover the cost of the room for that night as I had to sleep on the floor in the hotel as it was already 7pm at night and I needed my mother to have somewhere to sleep. I also didn't want to spend my last night of vacation stumbling around new York at night. Super travel sent me one email saying they were looking into options and they would contact me within 20 mins, but it's been silent now for 48 hours. In truth it's a shame, I am a big traveller and probably a customer they would want as a regular as I go away at least every month. I slept on a floor in new York.

I know how to handle such scam web site. to take screenshot for every step in their web site. in such way that they will not be able to say something different. the response below from super.com is incorrect and also misleading the users and the readers at TrustPilot web site. I have evidence for everything, and I will be glad to supply them. again. I am tough customer. I am not the typical customer that click next next without taking a copy of the reservation terms."

        "Details": "I booked a one night stay at a hotel I stay at frequently. Booked it through the app. Apon checking in, I was informed I booked it for the following day. I did make a mistake. I contacted Supers customer service via online chat. The app states that's fastest way to receive service . After a brief wait of 5 min or so I chatted with a rep. I explained I had made a mistake and would like to change the date to today. The rep informed me there would be a small fee of $30 to change the date. A small fee is not half the price of the room. After going back and forth with him he did waive the fee. He instructed me I would be getting a phone call from the department who can make the changes. He said he didn't know how long it would take. The first line of customer service doesn't have the ability to do much at all. Just a waste of time. No matter what the issue, someone has to call you back. I wait, chatting with the hotel staff for about 40 min. Still can't check in. I was able to locate a toll free number to call them. Hoping that a person on the phone could help me. I provided the rep with all the requested details of my booking and explained the situation. I asked if she could make the changes so I could check in. She said she apologizes but she can't. She said the dept that can is working on the changes now and id recieve a phone call within 20 min. A half hour comes and still no call. I have now been waiting to chage the date of check in from 8/7/23 to 8/6/23. Should not be difficult. So I again call customer service as it's been an hour. After providing all the details and explaining I have been waiting for a call and have not received one yet. She checks and comes back and says the exact same thing as last rep. She apologized for the inconvenience but the right department is working on it as we speak. She tells me id recieve a phone call from the department that can make the changes in 45 min.. Wait, What? I was told 20 min an hour ago. She said she was sorry but that's all she can do. I asked to speak to aa supervisor. .I was only trying to change a date by one day. Not buy the hotel. Shouldn't take but a few min. The rep said sure, I'll have a suoerviser give you a call. They will call in in about 3 hrs. I said nevermind and laughed. So your first line of customer service wether on chat or over phone is absolutely useless.  I hung up the phone with no choice but to continue to wait. It's been well over an hour since I had contacted them to change the date. I did receive a call from the department that I was told could fix it. The rep told me there was no way for super.com to change the date. He said he would need to call the hotel and have the hotel cancel my reservation I had for 8/7/23 and refund my money so I could book the date of 8/6/23 directly with the hotel. He contacted the hotel and called me back. He tells me if I follow through with the cancelation for 8/7/23 it will take 30 days to get a refund. he lead me to believe id get the refund right away so I could book today's date. I did not have an additional $90 to book another room since they took my money and won't get it back for 30 days. Super left me totally scared and I'm forced to sleep in my car for the night. Thanks super.com."

Couldn't reach Super via tele, BnB had no other rooms, so had to find alternative place to stay. Had online chat with customer service later that evening and they indicated that they were going to stick by their no refund policy. We pointed out that their site did not clarify that the facility had ANY rooms without attached bathroom & what we purchased was not what was delivered --- Choice was not willing to be honest in this transaction.\n\nUPDATE as of August 17, 2023: I turned to ElliotAdvocacy.org for assistance with this situation and provided them with the documentation surrounding the problem. I am not sure what they did but within a week Super.com had issued a full credit to my credit card.\n\nUpdate: They say they will not refund and we should reach out to the hotel to get confirmation that they would refund to Super. In other words, they want it to be our problem that they sold us a \"deluxe king room\" with no notice that it didn't have a bathroom attached rather than looking at their own advertising and realizing that they had not provided their customer (us) with an accurate description of what we were purchasing. It seems that they have the belief that if they fail to provide information to a client and the product is not as represented, they have no responsibility to make things right. We purchased from them... if they failed to get information from their supplier (the BnB), then it is not our responsibility to pay the bill - they somehow missed presenting the details on their webpage that would have alerted us to the fact that the room would not have a bathroom. We have no idea whether or not the Pepin Mansion misrepresented their accommodations to Super but this is a dispute to be settled between them and should not be up to us to absorb the cost of an error due to miscommunication between the Pepin Mansion and Super.com"

It was a \"computer Glitch\" and they could not do anything about it. I booked a room at a well-known, respectable, honest site, and took a $115.00 loss from \"super.com\" \"super travel\" \"SnapCommerce Inc\" I didn't know they have 3 names, so it isn't easy to track them if you have a problem.

They asked me to reach out to the hotel myself to inquire about my room type and the price difference between the standard and oceanfront rooms. However, when I contacted the hotel, they refused to provide this information to guests, citing their policy not to disclose negotiated prices.\n\nI reached out to super.com again, requesting them to contact the hotel directly, but they refused, insisting it was my responsibility as the guest to handle the matter.\n\nThis experience was extremely frustrating, and it's clear that super.com lacks proper support for their customers. I advise everyone to steer clear of super.com and opt for a more reliable travel website for your bookings.\n\nsuper.com, here is the Confirmation Number: B_10350809"

        "Details": "It was very easy to use the website format, it was actually faster than reserving a room on the traditional hotel website. I was worried there may be some kind of 'bait and switch' but it was straight up a great deal.   I saved 50% and would have paid almost twice as much on the hotel website. The room? No worries....it was one of their regular, very nice rooms with a king sized bed, luxury furnishings and a great view. It was not the traditional studio dive other travel websites are known for sticking it to you with, as they know full well you have already paid and have little or no recourse in upgrading or  requesting a decent, normal room. You know what I mean, the awful surprise waiting you after checking in at the desk and arriving at your assigned hotel room with high hopes and fingers crossed that your 'discounted' room is indeed a real room with clean sheets at least and a flushable toilet. One where the mold isn't growing on the bathroom door jams. One where the pillow cases are not infused with curly thick hair and the fear of discovering a used pair of panties stuck between the sheet and blanket doesn't give you anxiety fits. Indeed, one where the sides of the bed are not an advertisement for each guest to openly & without hesitation use the sheet as a handkerchief or be tempted to wipe other and all necessary bodily fluids under the covers for the maids to worry about later. One where the smell of incontinence has been at least 'fabreezed' away and the ice bucket has not been used as a handy 'throw up,' 'vomit' or 'puke' bucket. Even still, one where the ice bucket has not been used or conveniently turned into a bedpan or pisspot for each hotel guest resembling an Oger or last night's late arriving guest resembling 'fat lazy uncle Joe' who was so late he missed out on all the good rooms but Instead got a helluva deal on this room. Instead you are bartering with God for a real, 'regular room' with at least a double or queen mattress next to the porta potty still fresh with unfiltered blue chemical, able to flush at least once. \"A pleasant room,\" you ever so least silently pray for...one where the window is not obstructed 2 inches on the outside by the unsettling and cumbersome view of an enormous cement wall at least 200 ft tall.  One not allowing for any kind of view and certainly one in which you are unable to discern night from day.   No, other travel websites might stick you in one of their 'regular' or 'special' rooms. But not Super.com. Their room is all you prayed for and paid for\n  I had no issues, no problems and quickly booked my room. \nFurther, as is customary for other travel discount sites, they advertise a killer rate and anticipate you will click and check out the wonderful rate. As happened with 4 other sites, the room at this hotel was advertised for $39 a night, however when I clicked on those other sites to proceed, suddenly the dollar amount $249 appeared. There was no mention as to what happened to the fabulous $39 deal. Click Bait and I really despise those kind of fraudulent sights. Thank you to Super.com! They advertised the room at $49 and I actually paid $49. No hidden fees, no increases or upcharges. That is why I recommend it and wrote such a good review. I appreciate their integrity and will be using them again real soon!"

Despite the initial impression of cost savings, I regret choosing them for my stay at the Hilton on April 20, 2023. I canceled the trip on July 10th, which was the last eligible day for a refund. According to their communication, the refund was processed and should have been returned to the original payment card within 1-5 business days.\n\nHowever, five business days passed, and I did not receive the refund. Since then, I have made numerous phone calls and sent multiple emails, encountering unresponsive and repetitive responses from their agents. They simply state that the refund has been processed and advise me to contact my bank. I explained that my bank confirmed having no record of the refund, and I even offered to share my credit card statement as proof.\n\nTheir agents lack transparency and seem defensive, with one of them attempting to misinform me about the processing time, contrary to their own stated terms and conditions. As of today, I have still not received the refund, which amounts to nearly $1000.00. This experience has left a negative impression, and I will not consider using their services in the future."

        "Details": "I am compelled to share my disappointing experience with SuperTravel, hoping it might serve as a cautionary tale for others who choose to use this platform for their travel bookings.\n\nMy ordeal started when I attempted to book a room at Centro Hotel Arde K\u00f6ln through SuperTravel. During the booking process, I was confronted with a technical error message stating, \"There was an error, nothing was charged.\" Naturally, I retried the booking, only to find out later that I had been charged twice.\n\nUnderstandably, technical glitches happen, and I wouldn't judge a service solely on that. The real issue began when I tried to rectify the error. I immediately contacted SuperTravel's customer support to explain the situation. Despite promptly reaching out and providing all the necessary details, my efforts to solve the issue were met with an unsatisfactory response.\n\nInstead of understanding the unique circumstances of my case and working on a fair resolution, I was met with a rigid stance that the booking was non-refundable and non-amendable. While I respect the policy in normal circumstances, this was clearly a case of a technical error, resulting in an unintended double booking.\n\nThe handling of my situation was not just disappointing, but I found it to be somewhat humiliating. The lack of empathy and the apparent unwillingness to address a problem that originated from their own system was surprising and disheartening. It's a sad state of affairs when the burden of rectifying a mistake falls on the customer, not the service provider.\n\nI now find myself having to involve my bank to dispute the charges and resolve a situation that could have been easily addressed with some understanding and customer-focused support from SuperTravel.\n\nIn summary, potential customers should be aware of my experience. I would advise caution when dealing with SuperTravel, given my encounter with a technical glitch and subsequent subpar customer service. As a result of this incident, I will likely not be utilizing their services again in the future. It's crucial for any business, especially in the travel industry, to not just provide a platform for booking but also reliable and fair customer support when things go awry. Unfortunately, based on my experience, SuperTravel falls short in this regard.\n\nEDIT: I GAVE THEM ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND AM WAITING FOR ANY RESPONSE"

We could not afford it, but the hotel was amazing and agreed to cancel the reservation for a refund. They even messaged this booking site in their app. I am permanently disabled and my fiancee is very ill. This was like a anniversary outing, that went so bad by how we were treated. My fiancee was so hurt, we spent six hours in calls, emails, messages only to be promised a refund if we could get the hotel to confirm, which they did; provided name of front desk agent, email, phone number and instead they gave only become worse. We are writing every major booking company, ownership,  the BBB, our local and state authorities. We will not stop. Our reservation number (B_10247258) .

I would definitely recommend Expedia or hotels.com they have always provided assistance no matter what and I trust them so sorry I open this site even if it was a few dollars cheaper it cost me double now what I would have paid if I went through the Hotel.

I showed them the confirmation and the voucher super travel had issued but the hotel had no confirmation or payment. The hotel would only give us a room if we paid them directly upfront. It was very late so we reluctantly agreed in the hope it would be sorted in the morning. It wasn't. We contacted supertravel who were apologised and and advised a refund would be issued in 5-7 days. Almost 3 weeks later and despite us making contact with them several times and empty promises later we still have no refund. We have paid for a hotel room twice that we used for 6 hours.

Thanks for that Super.\n\nOriginal problem; when I booking this I received a confirmation email for the Hilton, aong with a second confirmation from booking.com for a hotel in Madrid! Same date, same price, same time confirmation email, same room type. But different website (I had not even been on booking.com so how was it hacked?). I have had to go in and cancel the mystery booking. So is my account, and therefore my banking details, somehow compromised? I do not know.\n\nAnd their response from my first review - before they took it down was;\n\n\"Hi Rich,\n\nWe are truly sorry to hear about your experience, however, we kindly ask you to provide the reservation ID and details of your booking so we can look into this further. Please also provide your email address used for the booking.\"\n\nWell that would be fine if you actually had a contact email address. You have a live chat system where the advisor refuses to answer the anomaly question., then simply confirms the first booking exists when it does not. \n\nWhat a mess."

        "Details": "Edit on July 24th: SuperTravel did not contact me until today because I called my bank to help with this issue. In their email, they seemed still not caring at all and asked me to explain my case to them again!!! Are you kidding??? They are just like a blackhole, trying to exhaust your time, money, and energy, and in the end, ask you: what happened? It is the most ridiculous company I have ever seen. \n\nEdit on July 10th: I would give a zero star or negative score if possible. I occasionally found that I was double charged when I booked a hotel using super.com. It is so hard to contact them and I was told that they would do some investigation on my case when I finally called in. So far I have not got any refund yet. I am not sure if they will refund me or not.\n\nI am not sure why I cannot reply to their response directly, but can only edit my post. Anyway, I would share a little more details. Last week I was told that they would contact me about my refund in 72 hours, but I did not receive any response or notice from them by now. I contacted them again, this time they told me I have to wait for another 5-7 days. Then they just refused to respond to any requests or questions. I will update my post if anything new comes up."

The hotel I was staying at charged me an additional $200 because they said SuperTravel did not pay them! I told the hotel I have a receipt of my payment through SuperTravel but it didn't matter since the company didn't pay them. When I started chatting with SuperTravel customer service, I gave my confirmation number and email, the representative said the email was wrong. I literally had to send them a screenshot to prove it was correct. After that, they told me to email customer support to get my refund. I haven't heard from ANYONE through email. I then just disputed the charge with my bank and hoping to get my money back that way. If I had known it would be this ridiculous I would've stayed away from them to begin with."

        "Details": "Synopsis: If you're reading this because you found a deal and you're worried it's too good to be true, then take this review as a warning of the risks in trusting supertravel. Obviously I can only speak to my experience, but if anything goes wrong with your booking, supertravel will not hesitate to leave you in the lurch and waste your time and money.\n\nCanceled my reservation 2 days before we were due to fly in at midnight. Left me in the lurch and did the absolute bare minimum to help me by giving me a refund that still hasn't come through. Cost me hundreds of dollars and a lot of stress as I needed to rebook at the last minute. Offered no assistance in rebooking a hotel, and I eventually found a much more expensive one through airbnb. They did give me a 20% credit for my next booking to make up for their mistake, but this is a clear attempt to just make sure I use their service again (which I never will). I can't warn people enough to avoid this service at all costs\n\nUpdates: Super Travel still have not issued me a refund two weeks after they said they would. I have reached out to them again over the phone since I left this review, and was told that someone would contact me by the end of the day (5 July) via email. I have not received any such email. This company has put me through an incredibly frustrating two weeks by cancelling my booking, failing to deliver the refund two weeks later, and offering barely any customer support. The only thing they did in a timely manner was report this review as being fake, and reply to it publicly. It should also be noted that the reply to my review offered no means of contacting them directly, and that they made no attempt to reach out to me as a result. Clearly it is an attempt at public damage control rather than a genuine effort to make the situation right and actually provide me with any help. To anyone reading this review who is questioning whether or not to purchase anything through super travel, I once again say do not do it! If anyone from super travel is reading this, then know that I am reaching out to you regarding this matter at your hello email address.\n\nFinal Update: I gave them plenty of time, but the promised refund never came. Had to request a chargeback. I figured I'd update because this is still going on, weeks after the initial call from them. The risks are really not worth it."

I booked through them and they booked through bookingvault. \nThey increased my initial ticket price and I asked to cancel and refund the money. They say in the email that they dont charge or book tickets if there is changes in the price which they did and charged my card. Now they tell me to contact bookingvault which they dont pick up the phone and their email is not working. I tell super.com and they dont care, they say its not our problem and the booking is through them. They give me fake contact info that doesnt work. Its business class tickets and its a lot of money. Now, no one answers the phone, the email is not working\u2026 I belive i got scammed. Please anyone with information how to reach them or do something.\n\nReply: THAT IS NOT CORRECT THAT I HAVE BOOKED WITH BOOKINGVAULT.COM. MY EMAIL CONFIRMATION SAYS SNAPTRAVEL AND NOT BOOKINGVAULT. IT IS YOU WHO HAVE BOOKED WITH THEM AND NOW ITS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE THIS BECUASE YOU HAVE OFFERED TO SELL ME THAT TICKET. ALSO I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU ARE THE SAME COMPANY USING SUPER.COM FOR HOTELS AND BOOKINGVAULT FOR FLIGHTS. NOW YOU SAY YOU HAVE CEASED OPERATIONS JUST TO SCAM PEOPLE. ITS YOU WHO SHOULD REFUND ME THE MONEY, I HAVE NO JOB WITH BOOKINGVAULT.COM BECAUSE I NEVER BOOKED THROUGH THAT WEBSITE WHICH MY EMAILS PROVE THAT. SO PLEASE REFUND ME THE MONEY ASAP."

I got a bit nervous because the confirmation message said it might take up to a few hours for the reservation to appear in the hotel system, but thankfully when I checked in at the hotel (about 15 mins after booked through Super) everything went smoothly.  Only minor annoyance was that I could not seem to locate N itemized receipt that broke down the room rate, taxes, and fees.  The fees were a bit steeper than the other sites which partially offset the room rate savings. But overall I was satisfied."

During this for hour I talked to them nine times but every time I had to explain my issue all over again.

The hotel didn\u2019t even know who they are cause my reservation never came in. Isn\u2019t it your job to follow up with the hotel since I booked through your app? Nobody helped and every time they said something different and I ended up booking another hotel. The last one I talked to supposed to relocate me but never called back.Stay away!! They don\u2019t care about their customers at all!\nHere is what I received after emailed them. \n\nHi Maya,\nWe are sorry to bring the bad news to you.

We call SuperTravel that night and they say they won\u2019t except a refund unless the hotel manager sends a signed email to them. The hotel manager said they never do that with third parties and didn't feel comfortable so they called them up instead and SuperTravel LITERALLY told TWO different managers that they needed the signed email to refund!  Can you imagine?!!  The hotel themselves calling the third party saying \"refund them\" and SuperTravel telling them no!  Avoid this company at all costs!\n\nUPDATE after their response:\nThey sound all kind and understanding but......they actually submitted paperwork to refute my refund at the credit card company with \"proof\" that the hotel charged SuperTravel!  Totally lied to VISA!  I have paperwork from the hotel manager SHOWING they were never charged and that the hotel cancelled the reservation on their end right away!  I'll be fighting this, but it looks grim guys.  These guys are crooks and they know they get away with it often!  Stay away!!!"

It was 20 miles away with far less acceptable reviews and where I had booked a room with 2 beds this one only had 1 bed. All for the same price of course. The email did state that if the alternative was not acceptable the reservation could be canceled free of charge. I responded I wished to cancel the reservation and please let me know when I could expect a refund. 3 days later I still had not received any communication from the company or any attempt to refund my money. I contacted my bank and disputed the charges, provided the proof that they did not provide the service and had the charge reversed. Within hours of taking that action I received an email from them about how I had initiated the a chargeback and caused my bank to remove the funds from their account. Funny you can respond so quickly when I take corrective action myself but can\u2019t respond for days and days and days to a customer requesting a refund when you failed to provide a room as promised. Bait and switch. Buyer beware. I will never use them again."

However, the \"check-in voucher\" they provided stated that the room that had been booked was an \"economy single\".  I raised this with Super.com and the agent agreed that there had been an error.  BUT - they refused to modify the booking to the room I had paid for, refused to cancel the booking, and they would not refund my money under ANY circumstances, even breach of contract.  I paid for a standard double room, the hotel gets paid for an economy single - classic \"bait and switch\"\n\nUPDATE:  10 days later and still no resolution from this dreadful company despite supplying them with the information they requested in their response to my review.  I have now begun a Section 75 refund claim with my credit card supplier.\n\nFINAL UPDATE:  Super.com's \"escalation to their urgent care team\" proved to be a waste of time as I was fed more deceit and lies.  Needless to say, they offered no resolution.  I sent my credit card supplier my collected evidence of Super.com's lies, cover-ups and double-dealing.  I received a full refund in response and the matter is now closed.  Some additional information about Super.com:  I discovered that many of the advertised rooms are, in fact, affiliate postings, Super.com not acting as a direct agent but only as a promoter, earning a commission from each booking.  In my case the room listings were falsely described and used images that were not authorised by the hotel in question - the hotel were not happy to learn of this and told me they'd be taking up the matter with Expedia who Super.com used to make the booking.  If you still want to book with these shysters, double check Super.com's relationship with the hotel first - it may turn out that they have no permission by the hotel to sell accommodation on their behalf."

Therefore, I wouldn't be able to check-in at the hotel.\n\nI contacted SuperTravel because I booked a day in advance, and I was concerned about not having a place to stay.\n\nCustomer Service was not good at all. They were not rude, but no one at SuperTravel took ownership of the situation not even their \"amendment team.\" Everyone that I talked to would speak as if they were reading from a script, w/no genuine desire to help. I asked to speak with a supervisor/manager, and the person that DID call me, only allowed the phone to ring once. They then sent me an email with a BS empathy statement. No one knew how long it was going to take to resolve my issue. \n\nWhile they worked on contacting their \"travel partner\" to resolve the issue, SuperTravel wanted me to go out of town with two small children without the guarantee that my issue would be resolved in time to check-in at the hotel. \n\nI requested a refund since they couldn't provide me with the service, and they said that my booking was non-refundable. However, they were going to contact their \"travel partner\" to see if they would approve my refund request. \n\nKeep in mind, that due to an eror on SuperTravel's side, I couldn't check-in at the hotel. Basically, they were holding my money hostage and they couldn't give me a refund without someone's approval.\n\n Lucky for me, their system canceled my reservation and automatically refunded me.\n\nThanks to this headache, I missed two days of my vacation."

It was supposed to be fixed by a certain time but the parts provider gave me bad parts. I had to change my hotel dates, I called the hotel and it was okay to change the dates with them, but they said I had to change it through Super Travel. Super Travel says you can modify the dates on their website, but you can't if the hotel doesn't allow cancellations and this hotel does not allow cancellations (though they will allow a date change). I had no choice but to call Super Travel. They've kept me on hold for TWO HOURS AND 33 minutes so far. I made it through a 34 person cue, made it to position 1, they kicked my back to position 4 in the cue, and then the kicked me back to position 11 in the cue. This company forces you to call them then refuses to answer the phones. They will royally screw up any travel plans and make my travel crisis exponentially worse because they aren't legitimate and cannot even do something as basic as answer phones. Super Travel is nothing but a time sucking scammer and they should be put out of business.\n\nEdit: I reported Super to the BBB for claiming to provide services (phone support) that they don\u2019t actually provide bc I had to stay on the phone 3hrs & 32 min total just to be able to talk to someone. When you have to miss half a day of work to contact phone services, that is not legitimate provision of phone support services because it places an excessive and oppressive burden on the customer to access the services. No one can miss half a day of work, or has an extra 3 hrs & 32 min, to utilize Super\u2019s phone support when travel plans get unexpectedly disrupted. If Super wants to review this situation, they should respond to the BBB complaint I filed."

So I raised it up with them, they did nothing.  I had to settle for what the hotel had given me.  I kept pushing super.com for an explanation or some sort of resolution and they eventually directed me to their amendments team.  They said they would provide me with a refund for my poor experience within 72 hours.\n\nAfter 1 week passed and no refund I contacted them again.  They ghosted me.  Every week since then I've opened the chat, followed up and all I get is an endless \"the amendment team will get back to you soon\", they never do.  It has already been a month and a half and no one from the amendment team has responded to my emails and the chat support is now on a loop saying the same thing.\n\nI'm just about to file a chargeback with the bank because I am now beyond frustrated.  Fortunately my lost was just a single night booking and I can live with that.  And being truthful I would have settled even for a partial refund, not even a full refund since I did use the booking after all, but the fact that they just ignore me, do not follow through and do not provide any sort of actual help when the issue happened left me with a very sower experience I do not want to repeat.\n\nUPDATE: you've asked me to provide you with a reservation ID and an email but failed to tell me where I should send such details.  Happy to provide the details and further evidence as needed but you'll have to tell me where I must send them since I obviously can't put them publicly here.\n\nUPDATE 2: Have sent requested info to super.com."

THEY ARE A SCAM!\n\nI accidentally booked the wrong date for a hotel, I called Super Travel within 5 minutes when I realized the wrong date was booked. I don't know how it booked the hotel for a full month from the date I actually needed it. I needed the hotel booking for the next day from when I was booking it. They were EXTREMELY unhelpful! All I wanted to do was move my reservation to the correct date. I didn't want to cancel and move away from Super Travel, I still wanted to use Super Travel for the booking. I just needed to move the reservation from the wrong date to the correct date. They still would have gotten the booking, they still would have gotten their money! They told me nothing could be done, try calling the hotel to cancel the reservation. I know that's not possible since I booked it through Super Travel and not directly through the hotel, but I called the hotel anyway to cancel it. Of course I knew the hotel was going to tell me I had to cancel it through the third part Super Travel.\n\nI disputed it with my bank and SHOCKINGLY by bank lost the claim! Super Travel prodived documentation to my bank that somehow showed it's my fault and the bank could not get my money back. So there was a reservation at the hotel that was never used and I was out of luck, having to pay for the room twice when I only used it once! The blessing though was that when I booked the actual date I needed, I booked it directly through the hotel and it was cheaper than going through Super Travel.\n\nScrew your policy about non-refundable! I didn't want a refund, I was still going to give you my money! All I wanted you to do was move my reservation to the correct date I needed!\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM SUPER TRAVEL! SUPER TRAVEL IS A SCAM!"

This room was infested with roaches and bugs. Took pictures and showed them to the front desk. No breakfast as advertised, just granola bars. Checked out the next morning (earlier than the booked nights) after making a first call to Super Travel about this ordeal. Since then, I'm following up with their call center to resolve this issue.

Not 20 minutes later I got a call from my oncologist stating they had a last minute cancellation to get my surgery done the following day. I booked a weekend. In less than an hour I tried to cancel my booking but the agent wanted proof. I submitted my original doctor's note I handed to work explain my stage 2 cancer, a new note explaining my upcoming surgery for Saturday, and even forced to send a picture of myself. They wanted official documents from the surgeon, which you do not get until your day of admission at the hopsital. I have never used supertravel before and shelling out 340 dollars, is something I cannot afford to just give up. I had no choice but to pass the surgery and wait for my actual surgery date which is in June. I was so upset. It was like they didn't care at all. Now.my weekend staycation ( as i cannot travel far at the moment) , is a bust. I have feelings of remorse. I'm really upset at how they treated me. I submitted actual formal Dr. notes from my oncologist but they said that was not good enough. I sent a picture of myself showing my bald head from my chemo and they still did not believe me. I sent my Last picture of my hospital band of last week showing I was in the cancer ward for my chemo and not good enough. These people truly do not care about customer care or service. I will never EVER USE THEM AGAIN. I will make sure to let everyone know from my work, FlightCentre, to take them off of our vendor list. I was told that it would be no problem to get a refund if I submit a doctor's note showing I have surgery which I did. Confirmation booking id: B_9609607. May 26 to May 28."

I call the morons at Super Travel, they apologize and ultimately do nothing but escalate it to the \"urgent team\", which is typical of garbage overseas agents and support queues. They said it would take 20 mins for a call back. It's been an hour. Guess this is what I get for booking with the cheapest hotel booking service. Good riddance.\n\n\nUpdate: Took them two hours from the time we arrived to the time it was resolved. We repeatedly requested a refund but got the run around 6,count them 6 separate times and calls. They kept telling us the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.\n\nUse another booking service for the love of God to anyone reading this review.

        "Details": "I am now being ignored by SuperTravel's customer support after multiple\u00a0attempts to contact them by\u00a0phone and email.\u00a0 On April 29, 2023 SuperTravel botched my\u00a0hotel booking causing me\u00a0to pay out of pocket for a similar room type at another hotel.\u00a0 As a final resort, I am now\u00a0working with\u00a0my credit card company to dispute the payment I made with SuperTravel for the room I never got!\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is the second time I have had an issue with SuperTravel.\u00a0 Below is a detailed\u00a0account of what happened and the lack of response\u00a0from SuperTravel.\n\nI reserved and paid extra for a one-bedroom suite at the Hyatt House in King of Prussia, PA so I could have separate sleeping areas for my family.\u00a0 Upon checking in at the hotel, I was told they did not have a one-bedroom suite available and could only offer a studio suite.\u00a0 I refused to accept this room because it was not able to accommodate my family needs in addition to being a downgrade from the room I had prepaid for.\u00a0\u00a0\nI immediately called Super Travel's support line from the hotel lobby to see if they could help resolve the issue.\u00a0 After a long hold, I finally spoke with a representative who took my information and said I would get a call back from a specialist in 20 minutes.\u00a0 After 40 minutes of waiting, I called back again and got into the long call queue to speak with a representative.\u00a0 When\u00a0I\u00a0finally did get\u00a0connected, I was told that a case was already opened and that I would get a callback in 10 to 15 minutes by a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt this point it was now getting late and my young son was getting anxious and worried that we would not have a place to stay as we waited for over an hour in the hotel lobby for SuperTravel to respond.\u00a0 I went back to the front desk staff at the Hyatt House and asked them if I could speak with the manager on duty to see if there was anything they could do from\u00a0their\u00a0end.\u00a0 I was told that Courtney Quinn, Director of Guest Services at the Hyatt House, was aware of the situation and reiterated there was nothing they could do other than cancel the reservation without\u00a0penalty because the room I booked was not available. I agreed to\u00a0them\u00a0canceling my reservation without penalty.\u00a0 I also asked for written confirmation that it was canceled.\u00a0 The Hyatt House staff refused to put anything in writing about the cancellation or room type being unavailable.\u00a0 They kept telling me to have the booking company contact them, which I said I tried multiple times to contact them and was still waiting for them to respond to me.\u00a0\u00a0\nMy patience was now wearing\u00a0thin.\u00a0 I had waited more than the time stated for a callback after the second call to\u00a0SuperTravel.\u00a0 This was now over an hour and a half since we initially tried to check into the room I reserved with SuperTravel.\u00a0 I finally gave up standing with my family in the lobby for SuperTravel to call me back and found another hotel 15 minutes away that had a similar one-bedroom suite available.\nShortly after checking into the other hotel, I finally received a call back from a SuperTravel\u00a0specialist\u00a0(almost 2 hours after I initially made contact).\u00a0 I informed the agent that I was now checked into another hotel and paid out of pocket more than my original booking.\u00a0 I was told that they were really sorry that I had to take matters into my own hands and that they would resolve the issue if I emailed the new hotel booking receipt to travelsupport with my booking id.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe next day, I sent an email to travelsupport with a brief recap of what happened along with my hotel invoice\u00a0for the hotel I paid out of pocket for.\u00a0 Three minutes later I got a response from Jannah at SuperTravel requesting me to provide written confirmation from the Hotel Front Desk that I was not able to use the booking, and why. I attempted to respond multiple times to SuperTravel support and each time I got an automated response stating that my ticket with the team has been marked as closed.\u00a0 Two days later, I sent a new email in an attempt to reconnect and never got a response.\u00a0 I then called multiple times the support line (844) 461-2577 and each time the recording stated there was a long wait to speak with a representative.\u00a0 On each separate\u00a0call,\u00a0I requested a callback which I never got!\u00a0\u00a0\nThis has been such a waste of my time!\u00a0 The booking would have only been $30 more had I booked directly with the hotel or another travel website.\u00a0 I have now spent many frustrating hours of my time trying to resolve this issue.\u00a0 In the long run, the aggravation this has caused is not worth any of the savings I have realized by using SuperTravel in the past.\u00a0\nThink twice before you use SuperTravel and be forewarned there is absolutely no support when you need it!"

When contacting the platform through their support chat, I was then asked to basically get a written explanation and confirmation and provide super travel with that info along with all the booking info. One annoying thing after another, just to get a refund on that cancelled booking. Worst hotel experience ever.\n\nEdit: updated rating since they actually refunded me, kept the rating low as it was a hassle, they only took care of it after writing this review. Separately I contacted my credit card provider to dispute the charge since I didn't receive the service, I don't know exactly which action finally made them act without me requiring to get the written explanation from the hotel."

Pass.\nThe second time was when we found bed bugs in the hotel room and the hotel manager closed the office early. Super Travel told me I had to talk to the manager and refused to help me further. The next day the manager got our message and said he initiated a refund through Expedia, who I guess they partnered with for my booking.\nThe third time was when I tried to confirm the refund as I hadn't seen anything in my accounts or email about it. They told me I had to submit a bunch of documentation for them to process it, despite the hotel manager already doing that. The customer service agent continually told me that they couldn't do a thing until I personally (not Expedia) submitted the documentation. He refused to answer why they didn't have access to what was already there, and then ended the chat before I got the answers I needed. \n\nHARD PASS ON THIS COMPANY. Not worth the lower prices they will NOT HELP YOU when you need it."

However, SuperTravel refused to send a request to booking.com or do anything else. As a result, I have lost a huge amount of money. They needed only to do a little servise but refused to move a finger. I would not advice anyone to book through this agency. To be precise, my booking confirmation number is B_9463581.\nP.S. In reply to my review, SuperTravel promised to contact the hotel to change the dates in the booking. The same day they sent me a message with the same promise, just to send later another message stating that they will not do anything. Thus, their promise to help in the reply is a lie."

Too many better options to waste your time with this company. Ryan Sy was supposedly the supervisor dealing with their internal error for 6 weeks!!! Was told them to not call back after 11pm or before 6am Pacific. Wait six weeks and get a callback at 3am!!! How convenient. AVOID\n\nUpdate:  Was told to call or email Super travel so the supervisor could address my concerns. Tried email, calling, and  chatting and never was allowed to speak with a supervisor nor did one one ever return my call or email. Now almost 2 mos have past since their reservation error and their error has NOT been corrected. I have only requested that the reservation be placed in my son\u2019s name so he will be able to correctly check in. Seemed like a simple request to correct their error. Now I will notify my CC company for a refund  request. Absolute joke of a company. No customer service. They do know how to read from a service manual.  Never again\n\nAddendum: I have been patiently waiting for 3 months for this Customer Service team to correct their own in house error. They placed my name on reservation instead of my son. There has been NO follow up.  This company reeks incompetence. Don\u2019t repeat our mistake and seek a legitimate travel agency to complete your travel plans\nAddendum: It has been 5 mos and was contacted by customer via email today and was notified that nothing could be done correct their internal error. This reservation error of theirs could not be changed in their system??? 5 mos to correct a first name reservation error. Unbelievable. Never again. Waste of time and money. Use any online travel agency BUT this one."

The listing made no reference to that. \nI contacted customer service for options to remedy the fact that I cannot charge the speaker and received a prompt response advising me that the problem is now mine, not theirs.    \nI was advised that they don't have any and that I should go out and find and then buy a cable that will work. \nTicket closed ! \nI will return the item and hopefully the next buyer has a charger and cable in reserve before they buy the recycled crap. \nDefinitely cannot recommend this seller.

I was able to cancel it out but I've called the Flagstaff hotel and they have zero record of my booking. Don't bother, it's  a sketchy scam company and they have a zero refund policy.\n\nETA: Yes I did contact the chat bot to try and ensure that everything was cancelled when I received a confirmation for a hotel in INDIA. Since I only paid $23 for the booking I was fine not being refunded for the reservation but I wanted to ensure I wouldn't be charged anything for a cancellation or a no-show for a hotel in INDIA and I wanted to be sure I had nothing on the books for anything at all in Flagstaff anyway. The hotel in India was kind enough to send me a confirmation of the cancellation and the refund of my $23 but every time I called the Arizona hotel they said they had no record of me (which was reassuring but shows that nothing was handled correctly to begin with). Not even sure what went wrong with this transaction but my advice would just be to book directly with the hotel or a reputable booking company in the future."

Super Travel blamed the hotel for not opening rooms for third party reservations until closer to the check in date, which made no sense because one of the rooms was confirmed. I got nothing but runaround and scripted answers from Super Travel for 4 months.

Since SuperShop uses econo-FEDEX then they must initiate claim. Instead of doing so they trying to close my case without a refund. No delivery picture and I cannot file the claim. Please know that even though they say your complaint is being investigated - they do not. This company is a scam."

        "Title": "This company is straight up not legit",
        "Details": "This company is straight up not legit.  I booked a hotel room for my son and grandson who has cancer - purchased the additional cancellation policy, knowing that due to chemo treatments, he often times gets quite ill.  Several days prior to this reservation, he got sick so I called to cancel even BEFORE the reservation.  Filled out the required Super Travel cancellation forms and then?  Crickets.....nothing.  I have called, emailed, and chatted - explaining the simple story over and over and over again.  Each time the rep promised to help and that the refund was in process.  Well here I sit 4 weeks later - nothing.  They do not respond well to emails and the chats are all responses being read from a script - I am just now back on chat and once they found out that I am looking for me refund - they disconnected and will not respond.  DO NOT use this company - 100% sham.\n\nUPDATE 5/11 As you can see the company reached out below acting as if they are going to assist (as they normally do) and once again, I submitted my cancellation reference number and repeated why I had to cancel...crickets!  No change to my original review.\n\n5/17/2023\nI received an email simply stating my ticket has been closed and they will no longer monitor my responses.  The response they post below is a straight-out untruth.  I filled out the required forms the day I canceled and asked numerous times (probably 15 emails/chat) if they had what they needed in order to process.  Again, just talked in circles with the same word tracks over and over and over again, never giving me any answers to my questions.  All I wanted to know is if they received what they needed (they did - it's a online form) and when my refund would be processed.  I would think a child with cancer would be an accepted reason for canceling a reervation and the whole reason I purchased the additional insurance.  But this company will do whatever they can do to avoid paying out.  I will never ever again go through a 3rd party to book a lodging stay - go through the hotel directly!  All in all I lost about $250.  Horrible service."
